# Something.js
## Adds something to your window

Something.js adds something variable that equals different window properties every time you try to get its value.

### Usage
```html
<scr src="somthing.js"></script>
```
And now just use something!
```js
console.log(typeof something) //'function'
console.log(typeof something) //'object'
console.log(typeof something) //'boolean'
console.log(typeof something) //'object'
console.log(typeof something) //'null'
```

You can compare your variables with something:
```js
if(myVariable === something){
  //...your code
}
```
